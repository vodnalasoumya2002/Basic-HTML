    <h1>SUNEO HONEKAWA</h1>
    <img align="right" src="suneo.jfif" width="150" height="300">
    <p>Suneo Honekawa (骨川 スネ夫ほねかわ すねお Honekawa Suneo), also known by his nickname Sneech in the American and UK
        versions, is one of the main character of the Doraemon franchise.

        He sometimes serves as the secondary antagonist in some comic chapters and animated episodes when he is bad or
        evil of the franchise.

        He is a spoiled rich kid who likes to show off his cool stuff to his friends and make them jealous. The friends
        he hangs out with mostly are Nobita, Doraemon, Gian and Shizuka. He sometimes brags to his friends to things
        like meeting up with famous stars.

        He gets around ¥5000 (US$40, £25.65) in monthly pocket money and buys cool toys and comic books, but he never
        lets Nobita touch his comics and cool toys, which provokes his anger and jealousy. He usually hangs out with
        Gian to think he is the coolest kid in the world like Gian and often bullies, irritates and/or beats up Nobita
        with Gian. Sometimes, his encomiastic tendencies come into play against Gian's threats. He is also a member of
        the Giants baseball team and while he isn't particularly proficient, he still somewhat surpasses the weaker
        Nobita.

        He is portrayed as a rather weak sidekick, only offering help to Gian for personal gain, although sometimes Gian
        demands from or even threatens him.</p>
