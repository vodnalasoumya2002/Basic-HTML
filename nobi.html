    <P>Nobita Nobi (野比のび太, Nobi Nobita) is a fictional character in the Doraemon anime and manga series created by
        Fujiko Fujio, the pen name of writing team Hiroshi Fujimoto and Motoo Abiko. He is also the main character in
        The Doraemons (special version). Known as Sidney, Specky, Nobi Nobi[citation needed] and Noby, in some of the
        English localizations of the anime, Nobita is usually depicted as an academically elementary school student in
        Tokyo's Nerima Ward and the only child of Nobisuke and Tamako Nobi, who is perpetually looked after by the
        series' title character, a robotic cat from the future sent back in time by Nobita's descendant.</P>
    <p>Along with Doraemon, Nobita is considered to be one of the most popular and widely recognizable manga characters
        due to the series' popularity, which extends beyond its native Japan.</p>
